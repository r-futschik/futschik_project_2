Connect to the server with your username. Then set up your ships, 
either manually or via a toml file. Take turns guessing where you 
opponents ships are until one the players destroyed all of the 
ships of their opponent.

Create a .toml file and open it. Create a simple variable 
called "ships". Then fill it with your ships.
Format: ships = [["startpoint", "endpoint"], ...].
There have been 2 example files set up for you.
There are four 1 size ships, three 2 size ships, two 3 size ships and one 4 size ship
